About issues
Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.
Many projects collect user feedback via a central bug tracker. GitHub's tracker is called "Issues,"
and can be used with every repository.

But we used the sources/Bugs.txt file for startin the bug tracking as soon as we have chosen
the Bug's tracking system.
